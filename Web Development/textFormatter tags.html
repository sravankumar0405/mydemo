    <h1><strong>Data Science</strong></h1>
    <hr>
    <p><i>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</i></p>
    <p>Not to be confused with Information science or Computer science.</p>
    <p><b>Data science</b> is an interdisciplinary academic field<sup>[1]</sup> that uses statistics, <mark>scientific computing</mark>, <del>scientific </del>methods, processing, scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data.[2]  
    <br><br>Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).[3] Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.[4]</p>
    <p><b><mark>Data science is "a concept to unify statistics</mark></b>, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[5] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.[6] However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.[7][8]</p>
